# Client
- The upload should be a client streaming rpc -- the return value doesn't matter to the client
- Look into Intel https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-movidius-neural-compute-stick that can interface with https://github.com/dymat/GOLOv2
- Since NMSBoxes is not yet implemented in gocv, we can leave that up to the application to annotate
